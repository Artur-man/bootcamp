Disclaimer

For the sake of clarity, the concepts mentioned in this tutorial have been simplified significantly. Linux is not Unix, but it is a Unix-like operating system. Linux system is derived from Unix. Similar commands you will learn in this tutoral may be applicable to other unix systems.
Most of the command line tools and programs we explain have many more features that cannot be found here. Linux command line tools are very well documented and their manual pages are freely available.
These notes are prepared for the users of UMMS Cluster. UMMS Cluster system has features that might not exist in standard Unix/Linux systems such as loading modules.
A rigorous treatment of topics on Unix and Bash can be found in various books in several levels.
